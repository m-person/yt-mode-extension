## YouTube mode toggler extension

This is a Chrome extension that switches between embedded and default modes for the current video on YouTube. Simply clicking the extension icon does the job.

Installation:
- download and save files somewhere on HDD
- open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
- enable developer mode
- click on `Load unpacked` and select the folder where you stored the files
- you may want to pin the extension to the toolbar for easier access, otherwise it will be hidden in the extensions menu
